## Homework 12

- Generate data from a "mixture model"

- Implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to your data

- Some potential points to evaluate: How similar are the clusters to the "true" mixture? Does this depend on the amount of data? How does the model change with the number of mixture components (keeping the number fixed in the generating model)? How well can you visualize your data and algorithm?
